## React Tutorial

For today's lab, you should do [the official React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) up through "Completing the Game." You can continue on to "Adding Time Travel" if you choose.

During "Setup for the Tutorial," you need to use setup option 2, "Local Development Environment."

The [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) section of the React documentation may be helpful to you as you go through the tutorial.
